Using the sample of active US equity mutual funds from 1984 through 2019, I find that AIV positively predicts benchmark-adjusted fund returns, and its predictive power is stronger for funds that deviate more from passive benchmarks. The predictability of AIV is also significant for active mutual funds in 47 equity markets and equity hedge funds in the US. I then explore two non-mutually exclusive explanations for these findings: 1) active funds require a reward for accommodating exogenous asset demands, and AIV drives their risk-bearing capacity (i.e., the risk view); and 2) they profit from private signals about firms' fundamentals, and AIV proxies for aggregate flows of fundamental news (i.e., the information view). Additional analyses provide evidence consistent with the risk view. First, on average, active mutual funds scale back their active positions when AIV rises. Second, funds that do not reduce active positions earn larger abnormal returns following high AIV levels. Third, a substantial AIV shock leads to a temporary impact on stock prices. The evidence during the COVID-19 crisis also corroborates the risk view.","tags":["Active Funds","Idiosyncratic Volatility","Asset pricing"],"title":"Predicting Active Fund Performance with Aggregate Idiosyncratic Volatility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["with Yucheng (John) Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1602889765,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602889765,"objectID":"97dca9f95721f843fe13b48fa0e42633","permalink":"https://www.shuaiyuchen.com/project/cross-border-ma/","publishdate":"2020-10-16T19:09:25-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/cross-border-ma/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Feedback effects","Cross-border M\u0026A","Institutional investors"],"title":"What Do Managers Learn From Stock Prices?

We hypothesize that the blockholders of a publicly traded media outlet affect this media outlet’s coverage of their portfolio firms in their interests. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that a news outlet issues more positive articles covering the firms in its blockholders’ portfolios. In addition, the results are stronger when the covered firms have higher weights in the blockholders’ portfolios. Our results are robust when we fully control for firm fundamentals by exploiting within firm-quarter variation in media ownership and coverage, providing evidence that the effect is causal. Overall, our findings suggest that institutional investors influence media coverage through their media ownership.","tags":["Institutional investors","Common ownership","Media"],"title":"Do Institutional Investors Affect Media Coverage?
